### Hadron structure main programs, run scripts and related work flows

Main programs and run scripts for running hadron structure measurements:
* Main programs call QuaHoG library functions for source preparation, contractions and I/O
* Includes interfaces to tmLQCD and DDalphaAMG solvers
* Includes post processing bash scripts which call QuaHoG/utils python scripts to handle hdf5 outputs
